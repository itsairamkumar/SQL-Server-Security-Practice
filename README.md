  # SQL Server Security Practice

This repository contains hands-on practice scripts for SQL Server security, focusing on real-world scenarios such as managing logins, users, table-level permissions, database roles, and security testing.

## 🔹 Part 1: Setup and Basic Operations

### ✅ What you'll learn:
1. **Create database** only if it doesn't already exist.
2. **Create logins** for four different teams:
   - DevLogin

3. **Create corresponding users** inside the `GoogleBD` database:
   - DevUser
   - HRUser

   - `Employees`
   - `Salaries`
5. **Insert, Alter and update** records.
